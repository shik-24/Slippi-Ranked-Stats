## Privacy & Security

Everything is stored locally on your machine. No gameplay data, replays, or personal information is ever uploaded or shared.

Updates are cryptographically signed — the app will only install an update that was signed with this project's private key. This means no one can push unauthorized code to your machine through the updater, even if the GitHub repository were ever compromised.
